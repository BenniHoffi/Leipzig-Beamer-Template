# Leipzig Beamer presentation template
Latex presentation template for Leipzig university.

## Status
Under development. 

## Notes
* It uses tikz for the background images.
* The footnotes will be added from the bottom. If you want to pull the footnotes towards red-black margin line then use <\addfootspace{}> at the end of the <\frame{}>.
* <\addfootspace{}> actually adds an additional vacant footnote (without counting that vacant footnote).
* To add more foot space add more <\addfootspace{}>. Don't do <\addfootspace{\vspace{1cm}}>.
* If you want to make any other page layout like <outline> page then add <\SpecialPageLayout> before that particular slide.
* Use <\GroupLogo{logo-path}> to add department or group logo.
